\part[3]
Explain the general ideas behind garbage collection by reference counting.

\begin{solution}
For each element on the heap, a counter is maintained.
At each assignment, the counter of the olde reference is decreased
and the counter of the new reference increased.
Heap elements with a reference count of 0 can be collected when memory for
a new element needs to be allocated.
\end{solution}

\part[2]
What are the disadvantages of this strategy?

\begin{solution}
Heap elements with cyclic references are not collected.
Furthermore, the additional instructions for counting slow down the execution.
\end{solution}
