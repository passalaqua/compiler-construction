\part[2] 
How does static analysis contribute to a compiler w.r.t. its architecture?

\begin{solution}
Static analysis takes place after parsing and before code generation.
It works on the abstract syntax tree provided by the parser and provides
additional information about name bindings and types to the code generator.
It furthermore checks constraints and reports corresponding errors to the user.
\end{solution}

\part[8]
Explain the generic approach of performing static analysis in rename/map/project/check phases. 
Use the example of type checking MiniJava.
