According to Edward Sapir, what is language?

\begin{solution}
Language is a purely \emph{human} and \emph{non-instinctive} method of \emph{communicating} ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a \emph{system} of \emph{voluntarily} produced \emph{symbols}.
\end{solution}

\part[5]
What is the formal language $L(G)$ specified by a formal grammar $G$? Give a definition in English.

\begin{solution}
The set of all \emph{words} over the \emph{alphabet} of $G$ which are derivable from the \emph{start symbol} of $G$ by \emph{repeatedly applying} production rules of $G$. 
A production rule is applied by \emph{replacing} its left-hand side with its right-hand side. 
\end{solution} 

\part[5]
Where are aspects from Sapir's definition of language reflected in the definition of $L(G)$?
Which aspects are not reflected at all?

\begin{solution}
Symbols are reflected in the alphabet, 
system is reflected in the grammar, 
and production of symbols is reflected in derivation.
Its not reflected that language is human and non-instinctive, 
that its used for communication, 
and that production is voluntary.
\end{solution}
